Apstract:
Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is crucial for
understanding interpersonal communication. Existing classifica-
tion methods often suffer from low accuracy due to vulnerability
to noise from environmental factors like lighting and occlu-
sions, imbalanced datasets leading to classification biases, and
challenges in addressing overfitting and generalization issues.
In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing GCF,
a novel approach utilizing Graph Convolutional Networks for
Facial Expression Recognition. GCF integrates Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, either through
custom architectures or pretrained models. Subsequently, we
distribute the extracted visual features on a graph network,
augmenting local CNN features with global features learned via
a Graph Convolutional Neural Network layer. Our methodology
is rigorously evaluated on benchmark datasets including CK+,
JAFFE, and FERG. Experimental results demonstrate that GCF
achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-
the-art methods. Specifically, GCF enhances the accuracy of
ResNet18 from 92% to 98%, and 66% to 89%,and 94% to
100% on the other hand it enhanced the VGG16 accuracy from
from 89% to 97%, and 72% to 92%,and 96% to 99.49%
on the CK+, JAFFE, and FERG datasets, respectively. We
provide a comprehensive analysis of our approach, elucidating its
efficacy in capturing nuanced facial expressions. By seamlessly
integrating graph convolutions with CNNs, GCF represents a
significant advancement in FER, promising enhanced accuracy
and robustness in real-world applications.
